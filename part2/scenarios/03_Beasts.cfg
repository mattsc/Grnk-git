It only works when the animals are extremely weakened and desparate to be saved from impending death. He also noticed that the animals get spooked if he attacks them with his magical weapons or his prunes. Once that has happened, they run away and there is nothing Grnk can do to calm them down any more. He therefore carries a normal, non-magical spear with him in this scenario and cannot use his prunes.

In practice this means:
  • An animal killed by a unit on Grnk's side joins Grnk with half its hitpoints restored.
  • The kill does not have to be made by Grnk himself.
  • An animal attacked by Grnk's magical weapons gets spooked and runs away.
  • This applies to his prunes as well. Grnk has actually tried feeding prunes to animals, but to no avail.
  • Spooked animals will not join Grnk when killed."}

The sheep, dogs and forest creatures (deer, tuskers, rabbits) have learned that they are no threat to each other and leave each other alone, demonstrating the enormous self control of a well trained sheep dog.
<i> </i>
There is <span color='#F00000'>one important exception</span> to the dogs' self control: if somebody on our side directly attacks a dog, the dogs forget all their training and go after all of us with utmost ferocity. If we are going to take on these dogs, we better make sure we have enough units to deal with all of them. They are extremely vicious."}
