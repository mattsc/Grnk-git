    description=_"Following the defeat of the undead, Grnk is disappointed by the lack of teaching he receives from his mentor, Wyssauba, and the soft, cushy life he now leads.  However, things do not stay calm for long and soon he must embark on his next mission to thwart the mysterious Master's Grand Plan, being again disillusioned and disgusted by the selfish motives of the humans around him.

This campaign can be played independently of Part 1, but pieces of it will undoubtedly make more sense if the player is familiar with the events of the first part.
