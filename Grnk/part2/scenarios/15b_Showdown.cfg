You can only recruit one level-1 goblin per turn, but recalling goblins costs only 13 gold. However, it is not possible in Wesnoth 1.12 to set the recall cost to 13 gold for one race (goblins) and to 20 gold for another race (orcs). Recalling goblins is therefore handled by first charging 20 gold and then refunding 7. This does mean that you cannot recall a goblin unless there is at least 20 gold left."}
