                {NARRATOR_GRAY _"Animal Conversion Procedure" _"Through experimentation Grnk has found out how he can use his charming nature (or rather: his magic) to make animals join him. It only works when the animals are extremely weakened and desparate to be saved from impending death. He also noticed that the animals get spooked if he attacks them with his magical weapons or his prunes. Once that has happened, they run away and there is nothing Grnk can do to calm them down any more. He therefore carries a normal, non-magical spear with him in this scenario and cannot use his prunes.
<i> </i>
In practice this means:
  • An animal killed by a unit on Grnk's side joins Grnk with half its hitpoints restored.
  • The kill does not have to be made by Grnk himself.
  • An animal attacked by Grnk's magical weapons gets spooked and runs away.
  • This applies to his prunes as well. Grnk has actually tried to feed prunes to animals, but to no avail.
  • Spooked animals will not join Grnk when killed."+{NOTE _"Unfortunately, it is not possible to set the normal spear as the default attack in the attack dialog without disabling the magical attacks altogether, so you have to choose it manually for every attack — unless you actually want to use a magical attack, of course."}}

Tuskers exhibit the same behavior as deer, except when an enemy is next to one of the tusklets. This enemy then experiences the full wrath of an irate boar.
<i> </i>
Tusklets blindly follow the closest adult tusker, except when there is no tusker left, in which case they behave the same as deer.

Rabbits wander randomly for the most part as well. In addition, they disappear into their holes (if any are within reach) when enemies are close. They reappear out of the holes at the beginning of the turn if they feel that it is safe to do so."}

This involves keeping them inside the area outlined by the path the dogs have worn into the meadow, positioning itself in between the sheep and approaching enemies <i>[if those enemies are within 6 hexes of a sheep]</i>, and attacking enemies that get too close <i>[within 3 hexes of a sheep]</i>.
<i> </i>
Sheep wander aimlessly except when a sheep dog is next to them, in which case they run away from the dog. The dogs exploit this by positioning themselves on the outside of the sheep, if possible. The sheep, dogs and forest creatures (deer, tuskers, rabbits) have learned that they are no threat to each other and leave each other alone, demonstrating the enormous self control of a well trained sheep dog.
<i> </i>
There is <span color='#F00000'>one important exception</span> to the dogs' self control: if somebody on our side directly attacks a dog, the dogs will forget all their training and go after all of us with utmost ferocity.
