----- 1.1.0, 7 Feb 2015 (port Part 1 to Wesnoth 1.12) -----

This is only a partial changelog for this version. A lot of internal changes
have been made in order to make this version work on Wesnoth 1.12, for cleaning
up the code or simply because the author decided to do things differently. These
sort of changes are not listed here. Only changes that are visible to the player
(and which are non-trivial) are mentioned. The complete change history can be
viewed in the git commit log (to be put up at github once Part 2 has been
published).

Part 1:
- Code updated for BfW 1.12. Dropped support of previous Wesnoth versions.
- Prose updated for a variety of reasons:
  - Consistency with the new (almost completed) Part 2 of the campaign
  - Clarifications of objectives etc.
  - Fixes for typos, clarity, story/prose improvements
  - Most of these are minor, no significant changes to the overall story
- P1S1 Flight:
  - Adjust map and starting positions of orcs so that Grnk cannot sneak by
- P1S2 Shmaltupp:
  - Bug fix for Grnk losing double MP upon advancing
  - Bug fix for wolf costing upkeep
  - Bug fix for Grnk not being able to attack on first turn on some returns to
    Shmaltupp
  - Bug fix for right-click option only being visible first time to Shmaltupp
- P1S3 Treasure:
  - Relax turn limit
  - Add right-click option to have Rutburt repeat his plan
- P1S5 Shadows:
  - Don't add undead guards in the cave when the draug is killed
  - Adjust how beacon time areas are removed; hopefully this fixes some of the
    bugs previously being present
- P1S6 Hunting, P1S11 Escape:
  - Use Micro AI for Lurkers
- P1S7 Disillusion:
  - Relax turn limit
  - Defeat of saurians is not necessary for victory any more
- P1S8 Trap:
  - Set up AI orc sides as each others' allies (so that they do not fight each
    other)
  - Make sure message by orc on skeleton recruitment is not skipped
- P1S9 Chaos:
  - Increase probability of nothing (no random event) happening
- P1S11 Escape:
  - make sure Mal An can never die for real (avoiding bugs in follow-up
    scenarios that way)
- P1S13 Wizards:
  - Gryphons now never attack Mal An, preventing potential balance problems by
    Mal An being defeated too early
  - Fix bugs with objectives not always changing correctly
- Other:
  - Bug fix: exclude border hexes from FAR_EMPTY_HEX macro results
  - Bug fix: images placed with HIGHLIGHT_IMAGE_SHORT macro are no longer in
    front of units
  - Change difficulty descriptions to indicate that this is not an easy campaign
  - Prevent Sergeant/Lieutenant/General line from advancing to Grand Marshal
  - Pickpocketing: do not let success probability fall below 30%
  - Grnk the Rouser: add a ranged attack plus an AMLA for it


----- 1.0.7, 3 Dec 2012 -----

----- 1.0.6, 16 Sep 2012 -----

- S5 Shadows: Added turn limit so that it is not possible any more to get
  unlimited gold, as reported by some players

  possible to draw him out of the keep and kill him


----- 1.0.5, 4 Oct 2011 -----

- Added workaround in last scenario (Wizards) to make up for AI sometimes
  ignoring hidden status of Gertburt


----- 1.0.4, 20 Sep 2011 -----

- S1: Orcs in south (Sides 5 & 6) can only have a total of 3/4/5 assassins on
  easy/medium/hard
- S1: Made sure pillager cannot have intelligent trait (in fact, I simply fix it
  at dim and strong)
- S2_04: fixed a couple typos in the dialog
- Added 'thank you' and URL info before first scenario and in closing credits


----- 1.0.3, 18 Sep 2011 -----

  fight is taken to castle, not pass; Grnk has more starting units, depending on
  difficulty level

----- 1.0.2, 15 Sep 2011 -----

Fixes of bugs found by players:
- S11: put Mal An onto recall list if he gets killed
- S13: Gertburt gets 'hidden' ability whether he's an Outlaw or Fugitive


----- 1.0.1, 13 Sep 2011 -----

Minor bug fixes and wording changes:
- Made sure Gertburt is healed and has full movement at S9/10 even if player did
  not go through S5 (also changes to the same effect in other scenarios, just to
  be on the safe side)
- S1: Added words for Gertburt: retreat to pass behind the fortress
- S11: Clarified wording of where Grnk has to go to meet the float
