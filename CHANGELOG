1.0.7, 3 Dec 2012:

1.0.6, 16 Sep 2012:
- S5 Shadows: Added turn limit so that it is not possible any more to get unlimited gold, as reported by some players
- S7 Disillusion: Karcyn cannot move or attack any more, so that it is not possible to draw him out of the keep and kill him

1.0.5, 4 Oct 2011:
- Added workaround in last scenario (Wizards) to make up for AI sometimes ignoring hidden status of Gertburt

- S1: Orcs in south (Sides 5 & 6) can only have a total of 3/4/5 assassins on easy/medium/hard
- S1: Made sure pillager cannot have intelligent trait (in fact, I simply fix it at dim and strong)

- Added 'thank you' and URL info before first scenario and in closing credits

1.0.3, 18 Sep 2011:

1.0.1, 13 Sep 2011:
Minor bug fixes and wording changes:
- Made sure Gertburt is healed and has full movement at S9/10 even if player did not go through S5 (also changes to the same effect in other scenarios, just to be on the safe side)
- S1: Added words for Gertburt: retreat to pass behind the fortress
- S11: Clarified wording of where Grnk has to go to meet the float
