----- 1.1.0 -----

This is only a partial changelog for this version. The big change is the
addition of Part 2 of the campaign. For Part 1, only changes that are visible to
the player and which are non-trivial are mentioned. The campaign is now also on
github. The complete change history can be viewed there.

Part 1:
- Code updated for BfW 1.12. Support for previous versions has been dropped.
- Prose updated to be consistent with Part 2. Most of this is minor, no
  significant changes to the overall story. Many other prose fixes, updates and
  changes for a variety of reasons, but also all minor as far as the overall
  story is concerned.
- Changed difficulty descriptions to indicate that this is not an easy campaign.
- Prevent Sergeant/Lieutenant/General line from advancing to Grand Marshal.
- Pickpocketing: do not let success probability fall below 30%.
- Grnk the Rouser: add a ranged attack plus an AMLA for it.
- P1S6 Hunting, P1S11 Escape: use MAI for Lurkers

Part 2: all new!
